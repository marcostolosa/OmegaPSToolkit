{sc.C}DESCRIPTION{sc.GR}:{sc.W}
       traceroute tracks the route packets taken from an IP network on their way to a given host. It utilizes the IP protocol's time to live (TTL) field
       and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED response from each gateway along the path to the host.

       traceroute6 is equivalent to traceroute -{sc.R}6{sc.W}

       tcptraceroute is equivalent to traceroute -{sc.R}T{sc.W}

       lft , the Layer Four Traceroute, performs a TCP traceroute, like traceroute -T , but attempts to provide compatibility with the original such im‐
       plementation, also called "lft".

       The  only  required  parameter  is the name or IP address of the destination host .  The optional packet_len`gth is the total size of the probing
       packet (default 60 bytes for IPv4 and 80 for IPv6). The specified size can be ignored in some situations or increased up to a minimal value.

       This program attempts to trace the route an IP packet would follow to some internet host by launching probe packets with a  small  ttl  (time  to
       live) then listening for an ICMP "time exceeded" reply from a gateway.  We start our probes with a ttl of one and increase by one until we get an
       ICMP "port unreachable" (or TCP reset), which means we got to the "host", or hit a max (which defaults to 30 hops). Three probes (by default) are
       sent at each ttl setting and a line is printed showing the ttl, address of the gateway and round trip time of each probe. The address can be fol‐
       lowed by additional information when requested. If the probe answers come from different gateways, the address of each responding system will  be
       printed.  If there is no response within a certain timeout, an "*" (asterisk) is printed for that probe.

       After  the trip time, some additional annotation can be printed: !H, !N, or !P (host, network or protocol unreachable), !S (source route failed),
       !F (fragmentation needed), !X (communication administratively prohibited), !V (host precedence violation), !C (precedence cutoff in  effect),  or
       !<num> (ICMP unreachable code <num>).  If almost all the probes result in some kind of unreachable, traceroute will give up and exit.

       We  don't want the destination host to process the UDP probe packets, so the destination port is set to an unlikely value (you can change it with
       the -p flag). There is no such a problem for ICMP or TCP tracerouting (for TCP we use half-open technique, which prevents our probes to  be  seen
       by applications on the destination host).

       In  the modern network environment the traditional traceroute methods can not be always applicable, because of widespread use of firewalls.  Such
       firewalls filter the "unlikely" UDP ports, or even ICMP echoes.  To solve this, some additional tracerouting methods are  implemented  (including
       tcp),  see LIST OF AVAILABLE METHODS below. Such methods try to use particular protocol and source/destination port, in order to bypass firewalls
       (to be seen by firewalls just as a start of allowed type of a network session).

{sc.C}COMMANDS{sc.GR}:{sc.W}

       {sc.B}help{sc.W}
           Print help info and exit.

       {sc.B}clear{sc.W}
           Clear the terminal (the {sc.R}cls{sc.W} (the windows clear command) command can't be run)

       {sc.B}leave{sc.W}
           Leave the traceroute tool

       {sc.B}man traceroute{sc.W}
           Show this message and exit

{sc.C}OPTIONS{sc.GR}:{sc.W}
       -{sc.R}4, -{sc.R}6{sc.W} Explicitly force IPv4 or IPv6 tracerouting. By default, the program will try to resolve the name given, and choose the appropriate  proto‐
              col automatically. If resolving a host name returns both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, traceroute will use IPv4.

       -{sc.R}I{sc.W}, --{sc.R}icmp{sc.W}
              Use ICMP ECHO for probes

       -{sc.R}T{sc.W}, --{sc.R}tcp{sc.W}
              Use TCP SYN for probes

       -{sc.R}d{sc.W}, --{sc.R}debug{sc.W}
              Enable socket level debugging (when the Linux kernel supports it)

       -{sc.R}F{sc.W}, --{sc.R}dont-fragments{sc.W}
              Do not fragment probe packets. (For IPv4 it also sets DF bit, which tells intermediate routers not to fragment remotely as well).

              Varying  the size of the probing packet by the packet_len command line parameter, you can manually obtain information about the MTU of in‐
              dividual network hops. The --mtu option (see below) tries to do this automatically.

              Note, that non-fragmented features (like -F or --mtu) work properly since the Linux kernel 2.6.22 only.  Before that version, IPv6 was al‐
              ways  fragmented, IPv4 could use the once the discovered final mtu only (from the route cache), which can be less than the actual mtu of a
              device.

       -{sc.R}f{sc.W} {sc.O}first_ttl{sc.W}, --{sc.R}first{sc.P}={sc.O}first_ttl{sc.W}
              Specifies with what TTL to start. Defaults to 1.

       -{sc.R}g{sc.W} {sc.O}gateway{sc.W}, --{sc.R}gateway{sc.P}={sc.O}gateway{sc.W}
              Tells traceroute to add an IP source routing option to the outgoing packet that tells the network to route the packet through  the  speci‐
              fied  gateway  (most  routers  have  disabled source routing for security reasons).  In general, several gateway's is allowed (comma sepa‐
              rated). For IPv6, the form of num,addr,addr...  is allowed, where num is a route header type (default is type 2). Note the  type  0  route
              header is now deprecated (rfc5095).

       -{sc.R}i{sc.W} {sc.O}interface{sc.W}, --{sc.R}interface{sc.P}={sc.O}interface{sc.W}
              Specifies  the  interface through which traceroute should send packets. By default, the interface is selected according to the routing ta‐
              ble.

       -{sc.R}m{sc.W} {sc.O}max_ttl{sc.W}, --{sc.R}max-hops{sc.P}={sc.O}max_ttl{sc.W}
              Specifies the maximum number of hops (max time-to-live value) traceroute will probe. The default is 30.

       -{sc.R}N {sc.O}squeries{sc.W}, --{sc.R}sim-queries{sc.P}={sc.O}squeries{sc.W}
              Specifies the number of probe packets sent out simultaneously.  Sending several probes concurrently can speed up traceroute  considerably.
              The default value is 16.
              Note  that  some  routers and hosts can use ICMP rate throttling. In such a situation specifying too large number can lead to loss of some
              responses.

       -{sc.R}n{sc.W}     Do not try to map IP addresses to host names when displaying them.

       -{sc.R}p {sc.O}port{sc.W}, --{sc.R}port{sc.P}={sc.O}port{sc.W}
              For UDP tracing, specifies the destination port base traceroute will use (the destination port number will be incremented by each probe).
              For ICMP tracing, specifies the initial ICMP sequence value (incremented by each probe too).
              For TCP and others specifies just the (constant) destination port to connect. When using  the  tcptraceroute  wrapper,  -p  specifies  the
              source port.

       -{sc.R}t {sc.O}tos{sc.W}, --{sc.R}tos{sc.P}={sc.O}tos{sc.W}
              For IPv4, set the Type of Service (TOS) and Precedence value. Useful values are 16 (low delay) and 8 (high throughput). Note that in order
              to use some TOS precedence values, you have to be super user.
              For IPv6, set the Traffic Control value.

       -{sc.R}l {sc.O}flow_label{sc.W}, --{sc.R}flowlabel{sc.P}={sc.O}flow_label{sc.W}
              Use specified flow_label for IPv6 packets.

       -{sc.R}w {sc.O}max{sc.W}[,{sc.O}here{sc.W},{sc.O}near{sc.W}], --{sc.R}wait{sc.P}={sc.O}max{sc.W}[,{sc.O}here{sc.W},{sc.O}near{sc.W}]{sc.W}
              Determines how long to wait for a response to a probe.

              There are three (in general) float values separated by a comma (or a slash).  Max specifies the maximum time (in seconds, default 5.0)  to
              wait, in any case.

              Traditional  traceroute  implementation  always  waited whole max seconds for any probe. But if we already have some replies from the same
              hop, or even from some next hop, we can use the round trip time of such a reply as a hint to determine the  actual  reasonable  amount  of
              time to wait.

              The  optional here (default 3.0) specifies a factor to multiply the round trip time of an already received response from the same hop. The
              resulting value is used as a timeout for the probe, instead of (but no more than) max.  The optional near (default 10.0) specifies a simi‐
              lar factor for a response from some next hop.  (The time of the first found result is used in both cases).

              First,  we  look  for the same hop (of the probe which will be printed first from now).  If nothing found, then look for some next hop. If
              nothing found, use max.  If here and/or near have zero values, the corresponding computation is skipped.
              Here and near are always set to zero if only max is specified (for compatibility with previous versions).

       -{sc.R}q {sc.O}nqueries{sc.W}, --{sc.R}queries{sc.P}={sc.O}nqueries{sc.W}
              Sets the number of probe packets per hop. The default is 3.

       -{sc.R}r{sc.W}     Bypass the normal routing tables and send directly to a host on an attached network.  If the host is not on a  directly-attached  network,
              an error is returned.  This option can be used to ping a local host through an interface that has no route through it.

       -{sc.R}s {sc.O}source_addr{sc.W}, --{sc.R}source{sc.P}={sc.O}source_addr{sc.W}
              Chooses  an  alternative  source  address. Note that you must select the address of one of the interfaces.  By default, the address of the
              outgoing interface is used.

       -{sc.R}z {sc.O}sendwait{sc.W}, --{sc.R}sendwait{sc.P}={sc.O}sendwait{sc.W}
              Minimal time interval between probes (default 0).  If the value is more than 10, then it specifies a number in milliseconds, else it is  a
              number of seconds (float point values allowed too).  Useful when some routers use rate-limit for ICMP messages.

       -{sc.R}e{sc.W}, --{sc.R}extensions{sc.W}
              Show  ICMP extensions (rfc4884). The general form is CLASS/TYPE: followed by a hexadecimal dump.  The MPLS (rfc4950) is shown parsed, in a
              form: MPLS:L=label,E=exp_use,S=stack_bottom,T=TTL (more objects separated by / ).

       -{sc.R}A{sc.W}, --{sc.R}as-path-lookups{sc.W}
              Perform AS path lookups in routing registries and print results directly after the corresponding addresses.

       -{sc.R}V{sc.W}, --{sc.R}version{sc.W}
              Print the version and exit.

       There are additional options intended for advanced usage (such as alternate trace methods etc.):

       --{sc.R}sport{sc.P}={sc.O}port{sc.W}
              Chooses the source port to use. Implies -N 1 -w 5 .  Normally source ports (if applicable) are chosen by the system.

       --{sc.R}fwmark{sc.P}={sc.O}mark{sc.W}
              Set the firewall mark for outgoing packets (since the Linux kernel 2.6.25).

       -{sc.R}M {sc.O}method{sc.W}, --{sc.R}module{sc.P}={sc.O}name{sc.W}
              Use specified method for traceroute operations. Default traditional udp method has name default, icmp (-I) and tcp (-T)  have  names  icmp
              and tcp respectively.
              Method-specific options can be passed by -O .  Most methods have their simple shortcuts, (-I means -M icmp, etc).

       -{sc.R}O {sc.O}option{sc.W}, --{sc.R}options{sc.P}={sc.O}options{sc.W}
              Specifies  some  method-specific  option. Several options are separated by comma (or use several -O on cmdline).  Each method may have its
              own specific options, or many not have them at all.  To print information about available options, use -O help.

       -{sc.R}U{sc.W}, --{sc.R}udp{sc.W}
              Use UDP to particular destination port for tracerouting (instead of increasing the port per each probe). Default port is 53 (dns).

       -{sc.R}UL{sc.W}    Use UDPLITE for tracerouting (default port is 53).

       -{sc.R}D{sc.W}, --{sc.R}dccp{sc.W}
              Use DCCP Requests for probes.

       -{sc.R}P {sc.O}protocol{sc.W}, --{sc.R}protocol{sc.P}={sc.O}protocol{sc.W}
              Use raw packet of specified protocol for tracerouting. Default protocol is 253 (rfc3692).

       --{sc.R}mtu{sc.W}  Discover MTU along the path being traced. Implies -F -N 1.  New mtu is printed once in a form of F=NUM at the first probe of a  hop  which
              requires such mtu to be reached. (Actually, the correspond "frag needed" icmp message normally is sent by the previous hop).

              Note,  that  some  routers might cache once the seen information on a fragmentation. Thus you can receive the final mtu from a closer hop.
              Try to specify an unusual tos by -t , this can help for one attempt (then it can be cached there as well).
              See -F option for more info.

       --{sc.R}back{sc.W} Print the number of backward hops when it seems different with the forward direction. This number is guessed  in  assumption  that  remote
              hops  send reply packets with initial ttl set to either 64, or 128 or 255 (which seems a common practice). It is printed as a negate value
              in a form of '-NUM' .

{sc.C}LIST OF AVAILABLE METHODS{sc.GR}:{sc.W}
       In general, a particular traceroute method may have to be chosen by -M name, but most of the methods have their simple cmdline switches (you  can
       see them after the method name, if present).

   {sc.C}{sc.D}default{sc.W}
       The traditional, ancient method of tracerouting. Used by default.

       Probe packets are udp datagrams with so-called "unlikely" destination ports.  The "unlikely" port of the first probe is 33434, then for each next
       probe it is incremented by one. Since the ports are expected to be unused, the destination host normally returns "icmp unreach port" as  a  final
       response.  (Nobody knows what happens when some application listens for such ports, though).

       This method is allowed for unprivileged users.

   {sc.C}{sc.D}icmp{sc.W}       -{sc.R}I
       Most usual method for now, which uses icmp echo packets for probes.
       If you can ping(8) the destination host, icmp tracerouting is applicable as well.

       This  method  may  be  allowed for unprivileged users since the kernel 3.0 (IPv4, for IPv6 since 3.11), which supports new dgram icmp (or "ping")
       sockets. To allow such sockets, sysadmin should provide net/ipv4/ping_group_range sysctl range to match any group of the user.
       Options:

       raw    Use only raw sockets (the traditional way).
              This way is tried first by default (for compatibility reasons), then new dgram icmp sockets as fallback.

       dgram  Use only dgram icmp sockets.

   {sc.C}{sc.D}tcp{sc.W}        -{sc.R}T
       Well-known modern method, intended to bypass firewalls.
       Uses the constant destination port (default is 80, http).

       If some filters are present in the network path, then most probably any "unlikely" udp ports (as for default method) or even icmp echoes (as  for
       icmp)  are  filtered,  and  whole tracerouting will just stop at such a firewall.  To bypass a network filter, we have to use only allowed proto‐
       col/port combinations. If we trace for some, say, mailserver, then more likely -T -p 25 can reach it, even when -I can not.

       This method uses well-known "half-open technique", which prevents applications on the destination host from seeing our probes at all.   Normally,
       a tcp syn is sent. For non-listened ports we receive tcp reset, and all is done. For active listening ports we receive tcp syn+ack, but answer by
       tcp reset (instead of expected tcp ack), this way the remote tcp session is dropped even without the application ever taking notice.

       There is a couple of options for tcp method:

       syn,ack,fin,rst,psh,urg,ece,cwr
              Sets specified tcp flags for probe packet, in any combination.

       flags{sc.P}={sc.O}num
              Sets the flags field in the tcp header exactly to num.

       ecn    Send syn packet with tcp flags ECE and CWR (for Explicit Congestion Notification, rfc3168).

       sack,timestamps,window_scaling
              Use the corresponding tcp header option in the outgoing probe packet.

       sysctl Use current sysctl (/proc/sys/net/*) setting for the tcp header options above and ecn.  Always set by default, if nothing else specified.

       mss=num
              Use value of num for maxseg tcp header option (when syn).

       info   Print tcp flags of final tcp replies when the target host is reached.  Allows to determine whether an application  listens  the  port  and
              other useful things.

       Default options is syn,sysctl.

   {sc.C}{sc.D}tcpconn{sc.W}
       An  initial  implementation of tcp method, simple using connect(2) call, which does full tcp session opening. Not recommended for normal use, be‐
       cause a destination application is always affected (and can be confused).

   {sc.C}{sc.D}udp{sc.W}        -{sc.R}U{sc.W}
       Use udp datagram with constant destination port (default 53, dns).
       Intended to bypass firewall as well.

       Note, that unlike in tcp method, the correspond application on the destination host always receive our probes (with random data),  and  most  can
       easily  be confused by them. Most cases it will not respond to our packets though, so we will never see the final hop in the trace. (Fortunately,
       it seems that at least dns servers replies with something angry).

       This method is allowed for unprivileged users.

   {sc.C}{sc.D}udplite{sc.W}    -{sc.R}UL{sc.W}
       Use udplite datagram for probes (with constant destination port, default 53).

       This method is allowed for unprivileged users.
       Options:

       {sc.R}coverage{sc.P}={sc.O}num{sc.W}
              Set udplite send coverage to num.

   {sc.C}{sc.D}dccp{sc.W}    -{sc.R}D{sc.W}
       Use DCCP Request packets for probes (rfc4340).

       This method uses the same "half-open technique" as used for TCP.  The default destination port is 33434.

       Options:

       {sc.R}service{sc.P}={sc.O}num{sc.W}
              Set DCCP service code to num (default is 1885957735).

   {sc.C}{sc.D}raw{sc.W}        -{sc.R}P {sc.O}proto{sc.W}
       Send raw packet of protocol proto.
       No protocol-specific headers are used, just IP header only.
       Implies -{sc.R}N {sc.O}1 -{sc.R}w {sc.O}5 .
       Options:

       {sc.R}protocol{sc.P}={sc.O}proto{sc.W}
              Use IP protocol proto (default 253).

{sc.C}NOTES{sc.GR}:{sc.W}
       To speed up work, normally several probes are sent simultaneously.  On the other hand, it creates a "storm of packages", especially in the  reply
       direction.  Routers  can throttle the rate of icmp responses, and some of replies can be lost. To avoid this, decrease the number of simultaneous
       probes, or even set it to 1 (like in initial traceroute implementation), i.e.  -N 1

       The final (target) host can drop some of the simultaneous probes, and might even answer only the latest ones. It can lead to  extra  "looks  like
       expired"  hops  near  the  final hop. We use a smart algorithm to auto-detect such a situation, but if it cannot help in your case, just use -N 1
       too.

       For even greater stability you can slow down the program's work by -z option, for example use -z 0.5 for half-second pause between probes.

       To avoid an extra waiting, we use adaptive algorithm for timeouts (see -w option for more info). It can lead to premature expiry (especially when
       response  times differ at times) and printing "*" instead of a time. In such a case, switch this algorithm off, by specifying -w with the desired
       timeout only (for example, -w 5).

       If some hops report nothing for every method, the last chance to obtain something is to use ping -R command (IPv4, and for nearest 8 hops only).
